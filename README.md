# python-ID-generator-for-students-and-faculty
This project will help to manage the department-level attendance system. In this, I will create a QR code using Teacher or Student Details. And this QR code will act as an ID card. And when students scan this OR code attendance is marked for that Student or Teacher. The main goal of the project is to reduce manual work and make thingsÂ Digitally
